            I tell them I favor the free-market, gun rights, and the abolishment
            of welfare and government regulation or the sweet tears of
            Republicans when I tell them I favor gay-rights, free-speech,
            secularism, and the abolishment of the War on Drugs and Terror.

            Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its
            victims may be the most oppressive.  It would be better to live
            under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.  The
            robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some
            point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will
            torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own
            conscience.

            To produce randomness can be quite arduous.  To this day, only two
            methods have been scientifically validated.  One of them is the
            infamous "Kitty Flop."  Strap buttered toast to the back of a cat
            and drop the animal from a PETA-approved height: if the butter hits
            the ground, record a 1; else a 0.  For more bits, repeat.
            Randomness results from the tension between Murphy's law and the
            feline penchant for landing on one's feet.  The other method is the
            classical "Coriolis Flush."  This time, go to the equator and flush
            the toilet: if the water whirls clockwise, your random bit is a 1;
            else it's a 0.

            It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the heart, rationale and

            greatest amount of debt and with all the security of the nation
            state's guarantee.

            Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program
            in the first place.  So if you're as clever as you can be when you

            Henriksen kalder et "knæfald for islamistisk matematik".

            Every time I see some piece of medical research saying that caffeine
            is good for you, I high-five myself. Because I'm going to live
            forever.

            If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue
            her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him
            by his private parts, you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.

            If taxation without consent is not robbery, then any band of robbers
            have only to declare themselves a government, and all their
            robberies are legalized.
